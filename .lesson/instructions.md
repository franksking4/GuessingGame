# Instructions  

Modify Listing 3.2 on Page 113 to play a guessing game with the computer. You MUST use Math.random() instead of the Random class used in the example.

The user picks a max number in a range (eg, 1-10, 1-100). The computer picks a random number. The user has to make a guess and the computer helps him along by saying "Too high" or "Too low" until he gets it right. The user can be allowed unlimited guesses, or you can modify the game to limit his guesses to 10 for example. Make it interactive and fun. You MUST use While loops.

Do not forget block comments to include the title, author, and purpose of the program.

Failure to follow instructions will result in reduced credit.
